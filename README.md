# CS231n Assignment Solutions (Winter 2016)
These are my assignment solutions for Stanford's excellent CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition class, where I aim for correctness, completeness, and readability. Solutions for all assignment tasks are included, with a few added bonus tasks.

These are just the solutions. For additional information on CS231n, see:

# Requirements
* At least 6-8 GB of RAM is required to run these notebooks.
* Should run out of the box on Linux and macOS with appropriate Jupyter installations. To run on Windows, datasets should be downloaded manually and modifications should be made to assignment 2/3's setup.py to correctly compile the Cython extensions.
